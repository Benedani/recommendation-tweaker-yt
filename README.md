# Recommendation Tweaker for YouTube
A purely client-side browser extension that gives you control over the YouTube feed!

## Contribution
There is a major amount of development work to be done here. This project is a goldmine for those looking for open source experience. Specifically, our goals are:
- [ ] setting up CI for "builds" of each commit
- [ ] cleaning the codebase up:
    - [ ] deduplicating the Chrome and Firefox sources
    - [ ] reducing indentation / lines of code
    - [ ] removing comments by making the code itself readable instead
    - anything and everything else to make the project more readable and maintainable
- updating the current filters following YouTube's changes to the website (currently a major issue, as the code has not been updated since Jun 6, 2021!)
- adding new filters (specifically age, which is locale dependent and looks rather fun)
- [ ] filtering the in-player recommendations (at the end of the video)
- adding support for additional browsers
- [ ] translations:
    - [ ] adding support for language packs (in the code)
    - adding language packs (translation) - I (Benedani) have got Hungarian covered
